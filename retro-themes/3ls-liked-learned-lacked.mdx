# The 3 Ls: Liked, Learned, Lacked

The 3Ls is a great data gathering activity, especially for retrospectives for a longer period of time.

1. Split the canvas in three areas:

- **Liked** - things you really liked.
- **Learned** - things you have learned.
- **Lacked** - things you wish had happened.

2. Ask participants to individually write notes on sticky notes for each of the areas.
3. Discuss with the group about the notes.
