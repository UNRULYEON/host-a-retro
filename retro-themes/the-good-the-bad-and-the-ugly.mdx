# The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a retrospective activity commonly used to boost conversations about improvements.

1. Split the canvas into three areas:

- **The Good** - things that went well, and we should repeat, do more of it
- **The Bad** - things that should have never happened, and we must get rid of it
- **The Ugly** - things that did not go so well, and we should look for improvements, turning it into it beautiful

2. Ask the participants to add notes to each of the three areas
3. Conversations and action items
