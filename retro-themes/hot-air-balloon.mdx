# Hot-air Balloon

## Host

Write down 2 stickies and put them on the board:

- Fire and hot air - On the top half of the board
- Forces pulling down - On the bottom half of the board

## Everyone

1. Write down stickies that fit either two:

- Fire and hot air: What helps us go higher? What are the things that push us forward?
- Forces pulling down: What are the things that pull us down? What are the things that hold us back?

2. The person who hosted the last team meeting goes first (excluding this meeting smarty-pants).
3. Place each sticky in the appropriate area and give a short explanation.
4. Appoint the next person to go.
5. Group the stickies by theme.
6. Vote!
