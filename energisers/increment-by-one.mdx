# Increment by one

Increment by one is a deceptively simple energizer. Here's how it works:

1. You have to **count to 15 as a group**.
2. The rules are:

- You can only say **one number at a time**.
- You can't talk over each other.
- You can't say the same number as someone else.
- If you do, you have to start over at 1.
