# Visual phone

Gartic phone on a budget. Here's how it works:

1. Everyone gets a sticky note and a pen/marker.
2. **Write a sentence** on it and place an **empty sticky on top** to cover it.
3. Pass the stickies around clockwise.
4. Look at the sentence, and **draw a representation of the sentence**.
5. Pass the stickies again clockwise.
6. Grab a new sticky and **write a sentence that describes the drawing**. Place the sticky on top.
7. Pass the stickies again clockwise.
8. Read and present your stack of stickies. Begin from the back!
