# I went to the beach and took…

“I went to the beach and took…” is a simple energizer to verify everyone's attention. It is easy to explain, fast, simple and only requires verbal communication. There is no need to write or to read notes.

1. Start by saying “I went to the beach and took…”
2. Then say one thing you would take to the beach (e.g., “a chair”)
3. Call someone else to continue the story.
4. The person has to repeat the whole sentence, add “and” and one more thing (e.g., “I went to the beach and took a chair, and my sunglasses”)
5. Go back to step 3 until everyone has participated in the story.
