# I went to the beach and took…

“I went to the beach and took…” is a fun memory game mostly played by children! Here's how it works:

1. Start by saying “**I went to the beach and took…**”.
2. Then name an item you took, like a **chair**!
3. Now it's the turn of the **the person on your left**.
4. They have to **repeat** the whole sentence, and **add another item** to the list.
5. Go back to step 3 and repeat until one of you messes up :)
